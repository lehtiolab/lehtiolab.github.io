Beyond chemotherapy, modern drug treatments now focus on targeted therapies. This approach uses genomic analysis of individual tumour samples to identify specific DNA alterations, guiding treatment choices. Despite advancements by targeted treatments, the continued occurrence of patient relapses highlights the urgent need for further developments. We have worked successfully on broadening the diagnostics toolkit to understand cancer and match effective treatments to patients based on this knowledge.",
